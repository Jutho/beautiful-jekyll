## Who am I?

*   My name is Jutho Haegeman. Since February 1st, 2017, I am an [assistant professor](http://telefoonboek.ugent.be/nl/people/802000026611) at [Ghent University](http://www.ugent.be) in the department of [Physics and Astronomy](http://www.ugent.be/we/physics-astronomy).
*   I have been awarded an ERC Starting Grant, acronym [ERQUAF](http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/205993_en.html).
*   I also have a Visiting Fellowship at [Perimeter Institute](http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca), in particular in the context of the [Tensor Network Initiative](http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/research/research-initiatives/tensor-networks-initiative).

## What do I do?

*   I am interested in strongly correlated quantum many body systems and quantum field theories, and in particular in how they can be studied and understood using entanglement methods and tensor network states. Check out my research on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=yfHe3OAAAAAJ) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/find/all/1/au:+haegeman%5fjutho/0/1/0/all/0/1).
*   I am also an enthusiastic user (and sometimes contributor) of the Julia Language. Check out my [Github page](http://github.com/Jutho) for Julia packages and related activity.
*   When not behind a computer, I love being outdoors, ranging from simple chores in the garden to hiking and backpacking in the most remote stretches of our planet. I also enjoy landscape and nature photography.

## Where am I?

*   I can be found (during office hours) in Building S9 of the UGent Campus Sterre, Krijgslaan 281, 9000 Gent (Belgium). See [Google Maps](https://www.google.be/maps/place/51%C2%B001'23.7%22N+3%C2%B042'36.4%22E/@51.023256,3.7092478,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d51.023256!4d3.710104).
*   I can be contacted by email or phone using the links in the page footer.

## What is my history?

*   I hold a master's degree in Engineering Physics (2007), and in Physics and Astronomy (2007) from Ghent University.
*   I held an [FWO](http://www.fwo.be) PhD Grant (Aspirant) and obtained a PhD in Physics in 2011 in the quantum field theory group of [Henri Verschelde](http://telefoonboek.ugent.be/nl/people/801000442621).
*   I was a PostDoc in the group of [Frank Verstraete](http://telefoonboek.ugent.be/nl/people/801001551653), first at the Institute for 'Quantum Optics, Quantum Nanophysics and Quantum Information' of Vienna University, and later at Ghent University. I then also obtained an [FWO](http://www.fwo.be) PostDoc Grant.
